### Chartering

Inspired by the online car-hailing services model, MOL introduced a cargo vessel matching system strived to make ship chartering process easier and cheaper. When a cargo owner issues cargo information on the platform, we match the cargo to ships by cargo type (vs. ship type), cargo volume (vs. deadweight) and cargo loading information (vs. Ship open information). The eligible shipowner will receive the cargo information and make quotation, the charterer can choose one or more shipowners to do direct negotiation and make a deal in a short notice, which will improved the efficiency of chartering; at the same time, before each voyage completed, shipowners will receive a list of cargos that match their vessel type in advance, which greatly improves the efficiency of finding cargoes and the utilization rate of the ship, thus obtaining more freight income.
