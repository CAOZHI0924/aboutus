### Chartering

Inspired by the online car-hailing services model, we strive to make the chartering process easier and cheaper. When a charterer issues the cargo information, we match the cargo according to the vessel type (cargo type), deadweight (cargo volume) and ship open information (loading port and laycan). The eligible shipowner will receive the cargo information and make quotation, the charterer can choose one or more shipowners to do direct negotiation and make a deal in a short time, which also improved the efficiency of chartering; at the same time, before each voyage completed, shipowners will receive a list of cargos that match their vessel type in advance, which greatly improves the efficiency of finding cargoes and the utilization rate of the ship, thus obtaining more freight income.

### Ship Supply

Providing spare parts, provisions,  lubricants, food and other marine supplies for vessels is one of the most important components of ship management, and it is also the most time-consuming and labor-intensive step. Vessels traveling between global ports, it is necessary to have a strong supply system to distribute dozens of kinds of ship supplies in a short port-to-end cycle. In the current industry background, many shipowners have to give priority to guarantee the efficiency of ship operations by accepting the high supply cost. We feel the helplessness and we launched a ship supply solution based on the e-commerce model: we invited the world's major manufacturers of spare parts, ship stores, and lubricants to the platform to open their online store; parts of the products are directly sold from Marine Online, and parts of the products are directly sold by the manufacturers. It minimizes the intermediate links to improve efficiency and reduce costs. In order to solve the problem of logistics and the last mile of delivery, the platform cooperates with internationally renowned logistics companies and the shipping networks of various ports to provide comprehensive services such as warehousing, customs declaration and distribution to ensure the accurate delivery of products. As a shipowner, you can either directly search for products and add into the shopping cart to purchase, or you can send an enquiry directly to ship suppliers for quotation, and then choose from several quotes based on factors such as price, payment terms, supplier rating, etc. to make the deal. After the transaction is completed, you can also rate and comment on the supplier's product quality, service level, and distribution efficiency to create a more realistic and high-quality service system.

Makes the rapid and low-cost recruitment of crew members and the training of crew members become one of the most important parts of ship management.
