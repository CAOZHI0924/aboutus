# Transaction Support Services

In order to enable the Buyers and Suppliers to settle the transactions securely in a trustworthy manner, MOL’s platform had provided the three main types of services namely, Payment and Guarantee System, Credit Evaluation System and Logistics Support System:

## Payment and Guarantee System:
MOL’s platform acts as a guarantor: Shipowners will need to make the payments to MOL’s platform first, thereafter MOL will inform the Suppliers to start delivering the Products/ Services to the Shipowners. After the Products/ Services had been delivered, the platform will release the payments to the Suppliers and the settlements will be completed. Acting as a guarantor, the platform ensures that the Products/ Services will be delivered with quality and satisfaction to the Shipowners, only then payments will be made to the Suppliers. On the other hand, the Suppliers will be guaranteed with the payments release straightaway by MOL’s platform once the Products/ Services had been delivered to the Shipowners. This will help to prevent delay in receiving payments or the risks in not receiving the payments.

## Credit Evaluation System: 
After each transaction had been completed in the MOL’s platform, the Shipowners and Suppliers will be able to start providing ratings and comments for each other. These ratings and comments will reflect the actual services levels, companies’ strengths and credits performances that the Suppliers had been providing to the Shipowners, and will have an impact in winning more orders. In certain situations, when the Suppliers are providing credit terms to the Shipowners, the Suppliers may also rate the Shipowners in terms of the compliance and payment credibility levels. This enables both the Shipowners and Suppliers to have trust and reliability when fulfilling orders on MOL’s platform.

## Logistics Support System: 
In order to support the high volumes of direct transactions between the Shipowners and Suppliers, and minimizing unwanted middlemen interventions, MOL is partnering with the renowned Third Party Logistics companies worldwide to provide professional warehousing storages, logistics delivery, custom clearances, delivery on board and many other full flexed services to complete your maritime transactions.
